80,"What consent is:
",,"Consent is an affirmative decision to engage in mutually agreed upon activity and is given by clear words or actions.
Consent is informed, which means that you know exactly what activity/activities you are consenting to, and the circumstances surrounding that activity. For example, you may want to ask your partner's STI status before engaging in sexual activity with them.
Consent is enthusiastic, ongoing, and revocable.
Consent is non coercive. For example, you should not feel pressured by age, status, position, etc. to engage in this activity.
Consent is not limited to sexual interactions, and should exist in all relationships.",
81,"What consent is not:
",,"Consent may not be inferred from silence, passivity or lack of resistance alone.
Furthermore, consent to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity and the existence of a current or previous dating, marital or sexual relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent to additional sexual activity.
For example, just because people hook up once, doesn't mean that they consent to a second time. Also, consent to one form of intimacy doesn't mean consent to all forms (eg. you might consent to kissing but not sex).",
82,Who cannot consent:,,"Assent shall not constitute consent if it is given by a person who, because of youth, disability, intoxication or other condition, is unable to lawfully consent.
Age of consent in Pennsylvania is 16. Teens between the ages of 13 and 15 cannot consent to sexual activity with anyone who is four or more years older than them. Individuals under the age of 13 cannot consent.
Some signs that someone could possibly be incapacitated and therefore unable to consent due to drugs or alcohol include:
- slurring words
- unable to remember or understand how they got from point A to point B
- memory loss
- throwing up
- passed out
- unable to walk
If you are noticing these signs in someone you need to stop and check-in with them.",
